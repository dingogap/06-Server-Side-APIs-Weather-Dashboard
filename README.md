# My Weather Dashboard

## Description

My Weather Dashboard is a useful Weather Forecasting tool that will help me plan trips.

As a bushwalker it suits my trip planning requirement right now - day walks and multi-day trips in remote areas of the Australian bush.

As an astrophotographer, photographing the Milky Way, Deep Sky Objects and night timelapse sequences I can see thew potential for extending the Weather Dashboard to get the information I need to plan these trips. At the moment I have to use 3 or 4 different apps or websites to get the information required.

Data available through the OpenWeatherMap API will let me tailor my Weather Dashboard to provide the detailed information I need in one place. It's pretty exciting!
