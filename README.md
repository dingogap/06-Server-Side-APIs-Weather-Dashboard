# Weather Dashboard

## Description

My Weather Dashboard is a useful Weather Forecasting tool that could help me plan a range of trips.

As a bushwalker the dashboard suits my trip planning requirement right now - day walks and multi-day trips in remote areas of the Australian bush.

As an astrophotographer, photographing the Milky Way, Deep Sky Objects and night timelapse sequences in a range of locations I can see the potential for extending the Weather Dashboard to get more detailed weather information I need to plan these trips. At the moment I have to use 3 or 4 different apps or websites to get the information required.

Data available through the OpenWeatherMap API will let me tailor my Weather Dashboard to provide the detailed information I need in one place. It's pretty exciting!
